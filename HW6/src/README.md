Month Class: The Java program in question implements the Month class, which has a monthNumber attribute that contains the month's numeric value.
Three constructors in the Month class can be used to set the month numbers. In the event that the supplied month number or month name is incorrect, the constructors will also issue a unique InvalidMonthException.

The getMonthName() method retrieves the month name based on the month number, and the Month class also provides a getter and setter for the month number.

The equals() method compares two month objects whereas the toString() method returns the month name.

MonthDays Class:

The Year attribute is a new addition to the MonthDays class, which extends the Month class.

It has a constructor that invokes the Month class's super() constructor.

The getNumberOfDays() method on it also returns the number of days in the specified month and year.

In order to return the days in the month from the array, the getNumberOfDays() function first determines whether the supplied year is a leap year or not.
