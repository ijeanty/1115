The FileWriter class is used to write character files. The FileNotFoundException is an exception that occurs when a file is not found. The IOException is an exception that occurs when an input or output error occurs. The static String output is a string that is used to output the data. The static int distance(int speed, int time) is a method that calculates the distance. The static void saveAsFile(String fname) is a method that saves the data as a file. The while loop is used to loop through the data. The printstacktrace is used to print an error message. The try/catch is used to catch an exception.
 
Explanation:
The code first defines the FileWriter class, which is used to write character files. Next, the FileNotFoundException is defined, which is an exception that occurs when a file is not found. The IOException is also defined, which is an exception that occurs when an input or output error occurs. Next, the static String output is defined, which is a string that is used to output the data. Next, the static int distance(int speed, int time) method is defined, which calculates the distance. Finally, the static void saveAsFile(String fname) method is defined, which saves the data as a file.
Next, the code defines "a try/catch block. This try/catch block is used to catch any exceptions that might occur". Inside the try block, the code defines a File object called myobj. This File object is used to represent the vehicle_info.txt file. Next, the code defines a Scanner object called fr. This Scanner object is used to read the vehicle_info.txt file.
After the try block, the code has a while loop. This while loop is used to loop through the data. Inside the while loop, the code defines a String called line. This String is used to store each line of the vehicle_info.txt file. Next, the code defines a String array called words. This String array is used to store each word of the line String. Next, the code defines two int variables called speed and time. These int variables are used to store the speed and time values from the words String array. Finally, the code defines a String called fname. This String is used to store the file name from the words String array.
After the while loop, the code has an if statement. This if statement is used to check if the speed and time values are greater than or equal to 0. If they are, the code calculates the distance and saves it to a file. If not, the code goes to the next line of the vehicle_info.txt file. Inside the if statement, the code outputs the headers for the distance and time columns. Next, the code has a for loop. This for loop is used to loop through the time values. Inside the for loop, the code calculates the distance and outputs it to the screen. Finally, the code saves the data to a file and closes the file.

The reason why the text files were generated outside the "ijeanty\1115\HW5\src\" directory is because Visual COde Studio wasn't recognizing the text file inside their. So, after hours of trying to figure it out, I just put it in ijeanty\1115 and it worked and generated the other text files there. I copied them to the HW5 directory so it could be easily accessible when another person wants to run the program.
